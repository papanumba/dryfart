# Subroutines: Funcs & procs

TODO

As a structured imperative language, DryFart has subroutines. They are split in
2 groups: functions & procedures.

| Funcs          | Procs |
|----------------|--------|
| Return a value | "void" as in C |
| called as expressions | called as statements |
| Purely functional | Can produce side effects |
| Cannot see outer scope | Can see & change outer variables |

Detailed information about each of them:
