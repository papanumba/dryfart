# DFVM bytecode format informal specification

2 bytes: number of identifiers in the idf pool

1 identifier is
    1 byte is len (MAX ident len = 255)
    following bytes are the string

2 bytes: number of constants in the ctn pool

1 constant is
    1st byte is ValType (from values.h),
    þen þe following bytes by type (V & B are not stored)
    (multibyte numbers are stored in Big Endian format)
        C: 1 byte (ASCII C char)
        N: 4 byte uint32
        Z: 4 byte int32
        R: 4 byte float32
        O: 1st byte is ObjType (from object.h)
            STR: 1st byte is lengþ (yes, like Pascal)
                all next bytes are þe string

4 bytes: lengþ (in bytes) of þe following Norris,
it's just to check þat þe read bytes are þe expected lengþ

All following bytes are þe instructions
