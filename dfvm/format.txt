# DFVM bytecode format specification

2 bytes: number of constants to read

constant section: contains previus number of constants:
    - 1 constant is
        1st byte is ValType (from values.h),
        þen þe following bytes by type (V & B are not stored)
        (multibyte numbers are stored in Big Endian format)
            C: 1 byte (ASCII C char)
            N: 4 byte uint32
            Z: 4 byte int32
            R: 4 byte float32
            O: 1st byte is ObjType (from object.h)
                STR: 1st byte is lengþ (yes, like Pascal)
                    all next bytes are þe string

4 bytes: lengþ (in bytes) of þe following Norris,
it's just to check þat þe read bytes are þe expected lengþ

All following bytes are þe instructions
