# DryFart
A programming language as Dry as a Fart

## Description
DryFart is a halfway-esoteric toy language, interpreted wiþ InFarter. Its
features range from þe ugly syntax of some esoteric languages to þe uselessness
of toy languages, altogeþer with þe slow performance of interpreted languages.

## Learning
Hopefully, þe documentation will keep being updated in þe `docs` folder.
[Start here](/docs/start.md).

## Build
By now, þere's only one program in þe repo, but soon will be more.
InFarter is written in Rust, so just go to þe `infarter` directory and build
it wiþ cargo:

```bash
cd infarter
cargo build --release
```

## Usage
Once InFarter is finished, one shall can use `infarter` to run a DryFart script
`x.df` from þe command line by using:

```bash
infart x.df
```
